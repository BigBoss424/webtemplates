# Web Templates

This will be used to store all sorts of web templates for futher use in website development. 

I will be using these templates for different web development projects that I will be working on as time continues. 

#Templates to be added

## 8/9/2015 - I will be adding the following templates today 

* Bootstrap 3
* JQuery 
* Node.js
* Angular.js
* WordPress
* Joomla
* Drupal 
* turn.js 4

The goal is to create websites as effeciently as possible by using the latest web templates that are available. I will also be incorporating other custom frameworks with their own included API. As I begin development of within each of these frameworks I will be posting what I have done for each framework. This will be a daily project that I will be working on along with other web projects that will enhance my own portfolio aspects. 

Turn.js 4 is a template that enables the viewing of large pdf documents like magazines to be turned like a flipbook. I plan on implementing this into a bookshelf design for each of the magazines or like items to see what the outcome will be like.
